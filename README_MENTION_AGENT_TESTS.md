# Mention Agent Contextual Filtering Tests

This directory contains comprehensive tests for the Discord bot mention agent's contextual content filtering system.

## Test Files

- `tests/bot/test_mention_agent_contextual_filtering.py` - Main test suite
- `test_mention_agent.py` - Test runner script

## Test Categories

### Unit Tests (Mock-based)
Tests the filtering logic and response patterns using mocked responses:

```bash
# Run unit tests only
uv run python test_mention_agent.py

# Or directly with pytest 
uv run python -m pytest tests/bot/test_mention_agent_contextual_filtering.py -m "not llm" --no-cov
```

**Scenarios tested:**
- ✅ Regular programming conversations (should engage normally)
- ✅ Casual political mentions (should redirect gracefully) 
- ✅ Persistent agenda-pushing (should skip after redirects)
- ✅ Aggressive/hostile behavior (should skip)
- ✅ Light controversial humor (should redirect with matching tone)
- ✅ Philosophical discussions (should redirect thoughtfully)
- ✅ Genuine questions (should redirect to programming topics)
- ✅ Mental health crises (should skip - not appropriate for bot)
- ✅ Obvious bait/trolling (should skip)
- ✅ Community behavior callouts (should respond appropriately)

**Edge cases:**
- ✅ Empty conversation context
- ✅ Very long conversation history
- ✅ Mixed content (prioritize recent context)
- ✅ Bot message recognition
- ✅ Reply context handling
- ✅ Signature structure validation

### LLM Evaluation Tests (Real API calls)
Uses Gemini 2.5 Flash to evaluate the quality of contextual filtering decisions:

```bash
# Run LLM evaluation tests (uses API credits)
uv run python test_mention_agent.py --llm-only

# Run all tests including LLM evaluation
uv run python test_mention_agent.py --with-llm
```

**Requirements:**
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable in `.env` file
- API credits will be consumed
- Tests take longer to run

**Evaluation criteria:**
- **Appropriateness**: Was the skip/respond decision correct?
- **Grace**: Were redirects handled gracefully and naturally?
- **Community Spirit**: Does response maintain welcoming vibe?
- **Context Awareness**: Did bot consider conversation history?
- **Effectiveness**: Does response handle the situation well?

## Understanding Test Results

### Expected Behavior

**SHOULD REDIRECT (not skip):**
- First-time mentions of sensitive topics
- Light humor or casual references
- Respectful philosophical discussions
- Genuine questions without inflammatory intent

**SHOULD SKIP (empty response):**
- Persistent pushing after redirect attempts
- Aggressive, hostile, inflammatory behavior
- Repeated guideline violations after warnings
- Serious mental health crises
- Obvious bait designed to cause arguments

**SHOULD ENGAGE NORMALLY:**
- Programming discussions
- Technical questions
- Regular community chat
- Bot feature questions

### Structure vs LLM Evaluation Tests

- **Structure tests**: Basic validation of signature structure and configuration (no API calls)
- **LLM evaluation tests**: Real Gemini API calls to test actual contextual filtering behavior

All tests that actually call the LLM are properly marked with `@pytest.mark.llm` to exclude them from regular test runs.

## Configuration

### pytest.ini Configuration
The project's `pyproject.toml` includes:

```toml
markers = [
    "llm: marks tests that use LLM APIs (expensive, skip by default with '-m \"not llm\"')",
]
```

### Running in CI/CD
To exclude LLM tests in CI pipelines:

```bash
# Skip LLM tests (default behavior)
pytest -m "not llm"

# Only run unit tests for mention agent
pytest tests/bot/test_mention_agent_contextual_filtering.py -m "not llm"
```

## Contextual Filtering Logic

The mention agent now uses contextual filtering that:

1. **Analyzes conversation history** to determine user patterns
2. **Gives benefit of the doubt** on first interactions
3. **Gracefully redirects** sensitive topics to programming discussions  
4. **Only skips responses** for persistent problems or inappropriate content
5. **Maintains community spirit** through humor and helpful redirection
6. **Calls out bad behavior** when appropriate, like a good community member

This represents a significant improvement over the previous strict content blocking approach.
