"""LLM evaluation tests for Discord bot mention agent contextual content filtering.

This module provides comprehensive LLM-based evaluation tests that assess how well 
the mention agent handles various scenarios with appropriate contextual responses or skips.

These tests actually call the Gemini LLM to evaluate real responses, which is why they
are marked with @pytest.mark.llm and should not be run in regular CI/CD pipelines.

Usage:
    # Run only the basic structure test (no LLM calls)
    pytest tests/bot/test_mention_agent_contextual_filtering.py -m "not llm"
    
    # Run LLM evaluation tests (uses API credits)
    pytest tests/bot/test_mention_agent_contextual_filtering.py -m "llm"
    
    # Use the test runner script
    python test_mention_agent.py --llm-only
