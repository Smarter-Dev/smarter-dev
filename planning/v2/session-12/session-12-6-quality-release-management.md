# Session 12.6: Quality Assurance & Release Management

## Overview
Implement comprehensive CI/CD pipelines, code quality gates, release management procedures, and feature flag systems. This subsection focuses on ensuring high code quality and reliable release processes for ongoing platform development.

## Key Components
- Complete CI/CD pipeline with automated testing and deployment
- Code quality gates with automated scanning and reviews
- Release management with versioning and changelog generation
- Feature flags for controlled rollouts and A/B testing
- Rollback procedures and deployment safety measures
- Automated testing across multiple environments
- Performance regression testing and monitoring
- Code coverage and quality metrics tracking

## Goals
- Achieve 100% automated testing coverage for critical paths
- Implement zero-downtime deployments with automatic rollback
- Establish code quality standards with automated enforcement
- Enable controlled feature rollouts with feature flags
- Maintain comprehensive release documentation and changelogs
- Implement A/B testing framework for data-driven decisions
- Ensure all releases meet quality and performance standards
