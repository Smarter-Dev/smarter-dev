# Session 12: Production Readiness & Operations

## Overview
Session 12 represents the final phase of the Smarter Dev 2.0 project, focusing on production readiness, operational excellence, and long-term maintainability. This session ensures the platform is operationally mature and ready for production deployment with proper monitoring, security hardening, scalability planning, and maintenance procedures.

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: Sessions 10-11 (API Implementation and Frontend Development)
- **Required for**: Production deployment and ongoing operations
- **Integrates with**: All previous sessions for comprehensive operational coverage
