# Session 12.4: Scalability & Performance Optimization

## Overview
Implement horizontal scaling capabilities, database optimization, CDN integration, and comprehensive caching strategies. This subsection focuses on preparing the platform to handle growth and maintain performance under increasing load.

## Key Components
- Horizontal scaling with auto-scaling policies
- Database optimization and read replica setup
- CDN integration for static asset delivery
- Multi-layer caching strategy (Redis, application-level)
- Load balancing and traffic distribution
- Performance baseline establishment and monitoring
- Connection pooling and resource optimization
- Geographic distribution and edge computing

## Goals
- Successfully handle 10x current projected load
- Implement auto-scaling for dynamic load management
- Optimize database performance with read replicas and connection pooling
- Achieve sub-200ms response times for 95% of requests
- Implement comprehensive caching to reduce database load
- Establish performance benchmarks and continuous monitoring
- Prepare infrastructure for global user base
