# Session 1: Core Foundation

## Overview
This session builds the core infrastructure components that provide the foundation for all application features. It includes configuration management, logging infrastructure, shared type definitions, utility functions, and comprehensive error handling. These components are essential for a robust, maintainable application.

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: Session 0 (Foundation & Project Setup)
- **Required for**: Sessions 2-11 (all feature development)
